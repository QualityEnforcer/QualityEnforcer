# Contributing

So, you want to contribute? Great! There's a lot we want:

* Support for special handling of individual languages
* More stuff to enforce coding styles on
* Improvements to existing algorithms for detecting a certain style
* Anything else you think would be good to have

I'd ideally like to expand this project pretty far, maybe all the way to a build server
kind of setup. Your help is absolutely welcome in this respect.

## Code

Keep in mind, it's pretty embarassing if this particular repository isn't well-written :)

* Opening and closing braces { } go on their own lines
* ClassName | MethodName(parameterName) | PropertyName | fieldName
* Line endings: CRLF
* Indentation: 4 spaces

(*For those of you watching at home, those last two bullet points are quality rules that
Quality Enforcer will recognize as rules*)

In general, stick to the style that's already there and you'll do fine.
