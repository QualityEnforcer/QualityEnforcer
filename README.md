# Quality Enforcer

Quality Enforcer is a tool for making coding styles consistent across projects. It handles things such as:

* Line ending style (LF versus CRLF)
* Indentation style (tabs versus spaces)
* Trailing new lines
* Trailing whitespace

It can also do some basic code analysis, such as how much of a certain style your project uses.
